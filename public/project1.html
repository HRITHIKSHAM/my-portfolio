    <h2> FIGHT CLUB </h2>
    <img src="star.jpg">
    <p>I really enjoyed the detail that as the film progressed and The Narrator started 
        to lose himself more  and more Tyler starts to "glitch" or his image becomes blurry. 
        This detail made me confused at first because I thought that my computer was lagging 
        but it made sense to me by the end of the film and this simple detail helped in the long run. 
        Overall this is an outstanding film It has a great plot-twist, specially considering how early 
        this movie was written. Definitely a must see. </p>
